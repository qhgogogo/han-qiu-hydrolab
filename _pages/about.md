This is the website of Han Qiu's Hydrolab. I conduct research aimed at addressing critical global environmental and earth sciences issues. These encompass challenges such as algal blooms, groundwater contamination, hypoxia, seawater intrusion, carbon and nutrient cycle, energy transition, and the widening gap between water supply and demand, propelled by climate change, heightened extremes, human activities, and the resultant complexities in securing future provisions for food, energy, and water resources. I integrate process-based and data-driven modeling, remote sensing, field observations, and artificial intelligence (AI) to advance understanding and improve predictive capabilities of co-evolving processes across scales, from sites and watersheds to mesoscales. My work emphasizes advancing next-generation modeling frameworks to bridge climatological, hydrological, agroecological, environmental and anthropogenic processes, capturing their complex interactions and feedbacks, and to inform policy making. Beyond applying existing models, I emphasize the development of scalable parallel architectures for mesoscale, hyper-resolution Environmental and Earth system modeling, coupled with the integration of multiphysical, biogeochemical, energy system and human processes. More recently, I have expanded this integration to include the human dimension by coupling water and Earth system models with integrated assessment frameworks, linking hydrologic, geoscientific and socioeconomic processes with policies. This holistic approach enables the assessment of resilience and adaptability within interconnected environmental, ecological, and socio-economic systems.
