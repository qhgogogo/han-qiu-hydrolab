Work experience
======
* 2024 May -Now: Research Scientist. Department of Sustainable Earth Systems Sciences, University of Texas, Dallas.
  * Simulating fine-scale wetland inundation and surface water–groundwater interactions to improve aquatic biogeochemical modeling using an integrated hydrologic and land surface framework.
  * Developing a near real-time digital twin of the Dallas-Fort Worth stormwater systems to enable data-driven analysis, long-term forecasting, and informed decision-making for sustainable urban development and effective stormwater.
  * Evaluate the multifaceted impacts of solar energy expansion on agricultural lands and the food–water–energy nexus, and to advance sustainable agroenergy landscape science and design.

*  2019.07 –2024.5: Research Associate, PNNL
 Atmospheric, Climate and Earth Sciences Division && Joint Global Change Research Institute, Pacific Northwest National Lab.
  * Improve hydrologic representations in E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model). Develop inter-grid lateral saturated and unsaturated flow and heat transfer processes in E3SM model. Development of Land-Ocean-Groundwater hydrologic coupling in E3SM. Apply parallel and cloud computing techniques to realize hyper-resolution integrated hydrologic and earth system modeling at continental/global scales.
